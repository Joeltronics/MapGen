## FAQ

**Surely there are better data sources than reading it from 8-bit PNG?**

Yes, definitely. But this is just meant to be quick & dirty - for the bulk of this data, it's not worth the extra storage space.

It's worth it for elevation, since we're calculating the gradient on that so we need more accurate data

And it's worth it for rainfall because the rainfall data scale is nonlinear.
